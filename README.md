# Age of Mythology - WinBar tool

WinBar is a tool in the spirit of WinZip and WinRar that can be used to open and extract .bar files. Such files are the default archive files in the Age of Mythology (AoM) game and its expansion pack "The Titans" (AoT). Note that the extended edition does not use archive files anymore.

This is a migration project from old code written back in 2009. As such, the quality is not up to par with my current standards (yet).
